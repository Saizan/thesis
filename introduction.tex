possiblity programming language => canonicity tells us we get results
if we run computations.

  - Succcesses in verification of mathematics and CS, see anders thesis for gonthier stuff, odd-order groups, CompCert.

  - dependent types also as expressive type system for a functional
  programming language, type guide development, type inference can in
  specific cases generalize to program synthesis, while in general
  invariants encoded in types constrain the possible programs towards
  the correct one (cite conor ``gravity well'' thing).
  %% you can program your types too!
  
  In this style where programs and proofs (of partial correctness) are
  intertwined, the latter can become a burden that litters the
  programs, which is why a variety of techniques has been developed to
  mitigate the needs for proofs, like careful definitions mindful of judgmental equalities, small and
  large scale reflection, other forms of tactics (cite pivotal?).
    
  Invariants can also be left out of programs' types entirely, but
  even then we would still be left with the burden of writing a
  program that the theory can recognize as total, which is something
  that mainstream languages do not request. The burden is significant
  enough that implementations like Agda and Idris provide pragmas to
  circumvent it and instead accept the programmers judgment and/or
  mark the definition as untrusted. (does Coq have something like this?).

  A core calculus would tipically ensure totality by only providing
  (co)induction combinators, which have the benefit of being easy to
  model, and fit well with categorical semantics as universal
  properties.  They correspond to primitive (co)recursion or folds,
  which, as witnessed by the develpment of powerful generalizations
  (cite ``Unifying Structured Recursion Schemes''), are not easy to
  use directly.The state of the art in proof assistants based on type
  theory is instead to allow pattern matching and direct recursion,
  and deploy more or less sophisticated coverage and termination
  checks, which none the less are fairly limiting, especially because
  they do not allow the programmer to provide their own reasoning to
  convince the checker.
  

\section{This Thesis}
  
This thesis is a collection of six papers divided into three parts.
The first deals with the induction principle of n-truncations in HoTT.
The second with guarded types and sized types as type-based criteria
for termination and productivity. The third with decidability of
conversion of type theory.

\subsection{First part}
The issues with writing programs we discussed so far also apply to
what might seem closer to formalizions of mathematics, as soon as the
latter involves non-trivial constructions.
Homotopy Type Theory (cite book) is a field that connects homotopy theory and type theory.
The connection centers around the identity type, whose elements can be
thought of as paths connecting the two values being equated. Types are
then interpreted as topological spaces up to homotopy.

It then becomes natural to classify types according to the complexity
of their topology, we call a type contractible if it is equivalent to
the unit type, then we say that a type has homotopy level n (or is an
n-type) if its (n+2)-iterated identity type is contractible. As a
special case 0-types behave much like discrete spaces, only one path
between any two points, and so are a suitable representation of sets (cite Bas set theory stuff?).
It just so happens that some constructions, like pushouts, do not
naturally preserve the homotopy level, e.g. build sets out of sets, (cite
pushout of Unit forming circle? from book), so they need to be
truncated to the desired level.
%% Given an arbitrary type A, its n-truncation $\tr{n}{A}$ is the least
%% n-type with a map $\trcon{-} : A \to \tr{n}{A}$.  Its standard
%% induction principle says that a map $\tr{n}{A} \to B$ can be build
from $A \to B$ as long as $B$ is also an n-type.
In the paper ``Functions out of Higher Truncations'' we relax this to
$B$ being an (n+1)-type as long as the function is constant on all (n+1) loop spaces.
%% define loop space
%% give a hint to the proof.
(Superseded by ``Constructions with Non-Recursive Higher Inductive
Types'' approximating truncations with a sequence (and
prop. truncation with a colimit of it))

%% quote from book ``homotopy n-type: a type containing no interesting homotopy above dimension n.''


\subsection{Second Part}
- motivate type-based totality checking (quite broader origins actually, then applied to type theory!)
  - show general problems, copy some examples from papers.
  - idea: approximations of mu/nu up to an ordinal. keep track of stages in types
  - (well-founded) induction on stages as a typing rule for recursive definitions/semantic model
    - examples 
  - overlooked in sized-types: some approximation chains never truly
  stabilize but are useful none-the-less: guarded types to abstract
  over step-indexing models. still terminating as types and fixpoints of sized functors.
  - Using nakano's modality instead of explicit stages.
    - give the Fref example.
    - also tying the knot example from Atkey?

  - Funnily enough such fixed-points can be back-ported to
    sized-types with a sufficiently strong language (e.g. higher-rank
    size quantification):
    
    - example: fix with SizeLt. Type of fix is quite different from
    (Later A -> A) -> A because we do not assume antitonicity.

    - termination problems if we are so liberal with sizes: ...
      - Maybe Size< should be banned as a type and only SizeLt allowed.

    %% Not So Sure About integrating this.
    - $\inf$ question: what is $fix (\ i X -> Later i X -> X) \inf$
    supposed to be? Do we really need $\inf$, or should we rather have
    unsized-fixpoints and subtyping/overloading? (c.f. Amadio 98 but
    also Abel13 typing rules for constructors)
     - Agda makes it complicated by $\inf < \inf$ and $\inf + 1 = \inf$ sometimes.
     - and generally the structural termination checker gets a bit confused with liberal sizes and uses of $\inf$
         - sizes can really make a seemingly-inductive type into more of a
         coinductive one because of unique fixpoints and the structural
         termination checker gets confused.
         %% I Like This Part.
         - really considering sizes as ordinals your programs can do
         induction over makes for better intuition of their power and meaning than sizes as just
         annotations to help with checking normalization of (co)recurive definitions over (co)data.
         Good strategy to find bugs in agda: find where the two intuitions clash.



-- state-of-the art and contributions i guess?

- paper topics:

  Guarded Types
  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  - stratified SN for a STLC with guarded recursive types formalized in Agda
    - Takes the ``finite approximations'' model at face value and blocks reduction when deeper than n ``next''.
    - Recursive types introduced by a coinductive type of types, term-level fix then definable by exploiting built-in type-level recursion.
    - proof with SATs and inductive SN characterization.
    
    - the stratification makes it awkward to use to decide, and which
    equality: at which n should things be compared? larger n's admit
    more things as equal, but what's a canonical choice?
    Maybe use the typecheking context/keeping track of how many next
    we have gone under? But not the dynamic context, that can be
    fooled into growing. Is this stable under substitutions?    
    - stripped of the guarded stuff, taken as prototype impl. for poplmark reloaded.
    
  - GCTT
    - GDTT, extensional dependent type theory with guarded types:
    conversion is undecidable, because of reflection rule but also
    because of unfolding-fix rule.
    
    - Removing reflection rule and making unfold-fix just a
    prop. equality would likely recover decidability but kill
    canonicity: we can prove closed streams prop. equal which won't be
    definitionally equal, so some closed proofs won't reduce to
    ``refl'' and J on them will get stuck.

    - Need a more forgiving identity type, one where more proofs are
    canonical: enter cubical type theory.
    
     - CTT takes the intuitions of Homotopy Type Theory a step
     further, and uses paths as the representation of equality proofs themselves,
     as in maps from an (abstract) interval type.
     Then function extensionality just follows, and even univalence by a special Glue type.
     The price to pay is more complexity in the eliminator for these paths
     , which in fact has to be given computational meaning on a type by type basis.

   - GCTT then integrates the later modality and fix into CTT, having a path for fix-unfolding.
     The technical trick is dfix and the path at dfix, not to mess with canonical terms at other types.
     Not having any proper eliminations for later yet, we do not need to worry about what canonical terms do.
     The prototype typechecker handles clock quantification and in that case we actually get dfix/comp/next unstuck.
     
     We provide a denotational model in $Cubes \times \omega$
     presheaves, which proves the consistency of our theory. The construction is presented from an internal
     perspective as much as possible (cite Pitts,Bas,.. paper on how this internal style got expanded on).

  Sized Types   
  -------------------------------------------------------------------
  - Parametric Quantifiers for dependent type theory + Normalization by evaluation for sized dependent types
    - too many zeros problem / not able to actually prove isomorphisms.
    - sizes make a difference when indexing types but shouldn't make a difference in values.
    - need a way to indicate when size quantification should behave in a uniform way
      - standard irrelevance like pfenning does not work, because codomain relevant in sizes
      - intersection types as in ICC* or something do not play well with eta.
      
    - if we look at the semantics of (co)inductive types as (co)limits
    of chains, then the condition we would like to impose is
    naturality. But internalizing naturality directly would require us
    to keep track of the variance of size variables in types and into
    the realm of directed type theory, which is not well understood
    yet.
    
    - However the semantics of lambda calculus give us relational
    parametricity, a concept which also tries to characterize the
    well-behavedness or invariance of maps for some of their
    arguments, and indeed also specializes to naturality in many cases.

    - Parametricity has been studied before in the context of MLTT,
    both in the sense of categorical models (cite Bob, and new ghani
    stuff?) satisfying parametricity and as extensions of type theory
    internalizing parametricity principles.

    - those works study how Pi itself enjoys interesting parametricity
    properties, in case the domain has an interesting notion of
    relation. However they are confronted with limitations with
    regards to trying to scale the identity extension lemma to
    universes, especially a hierarchy of them.

    The identity extension lemma, used to derive naturality from
    parametricity, would require that the relational interpretation of
    a closed type is just equality, but if this applied to our
    interpretation of the universe we wouldn't get any interesting
    theorem about polymorphic functions.

    Another way to look at this is that we would expect parametricity
    to imply that a function of type ``f : (A : U) -> F A -> G A''
    would be a nat. trans. when F and G are functors.  But if we have
    U : $U_1$ and take F A = Unit, G A = U, we could write
    f = λ (A : U) \_. U which does not fit into a naturality square.
    It seems that polymorphism-as-pi only guarantees naturality when
    the codomain cannot allow the information we are polymorphic over
    to leak.

    The solution of ``ParamDTT'' is to introduce new quantifiers which
    restrict the use of the quantified variable through a system of
    modalities, thus preventing such leaks even when the type of the
    value we are currently building would be large/complex enough to
    allow it.

    With those and a type ``Size'' which supports parametric-and-non
    well-founded induction we are able to internally build indexed
    initial and final coalgebras for functors that satisfy and
    internal notion of (co)continuity (similar to the condition in
    Rasmus paper), which includes (finitary-branching) polynomial
    functors.

    The drawback is that our version of identity extension is
    introduced as a propositional axiom, and future work is needed to
    recover canonicity. The theory already uses concepts from
    CoquandBernardyMoulin and Cubical Type Theory to discuss values
    parametrically related, so we expect we can also take as model the
    composition operation of CTT to give computational meaning to this
    equality axiom.

    We again give a denotational semantics in a presheaf model,
    %BCCube^\hat something, of cubes generated by two distinct interval
    objects, with a map between them, which we use as domains of
    respectively paths and bridges, the former represent equalities,
    and the latter parametric relatedness.

    We also provide a prototype implementation as a fork of Agda, by
    adapting the present support for --cubical and an irrelevance
    modality. As a side-product, the effort spent adapting the support
    for modalities to the ones in ParamDTT then meant the
    implementation was easily adaptable to other schemes of modality,
    which then to a prototype implementation of crisp type theory
    (cite Pitts et. al paper).

    
    - In NbE for Sized Types we also explore irrelevant size
    quantification in a dependently typed language, but here
    irrelevance affects judgmental equality, and our technical
    contribution is an NbE algorithm for conversion checking.
    
    The main hurdle is how to reconcile typed judgmental equality with
    irrelevance, since given $f : \forall i : \mathsf{Size}. T i$ we would like
    $f~i$ and $f~j$ to be equal, but they would naturally live in
    different types $T~i$ and $T~j$.
    \footnote{In ParamDTT, irrelevance only gives prop. equalities,
      and we have a notion of heterogeneous equality over two
      parametrically related types}
    
    - GDTT similarly has clock irrelevance, given $t : \forall
    \kappa. T$, $T \# \kappa$ then $t~\kappa = t~\kappa' : T$, the
    side condition makes the conclusion type correct
    \footnote{it is also required for soundness, but that's because
      clock quantification behaves more like an actual product than
      our $\forall$}
    , but it's not clear how to integrate the rule into a conversion
    algorithm as for example it can be used to prove
    $f : \forall \kappa. Bool \times T \kappa$
    -----------------------------------------
    $fst (f~\kappa) = fst (f~\kappa') : Bool$
    but only by reconstructing the term $t = \lambda \kappa. fst
    (f~\kappa)$, because the rule cannot be applied to $f$ directly
    due to its type.
    Maybe some form of anti-unification could be deployed but ``Clocks
    are ticking, no more delays'' plans on turning this into a
    propositional equality instead.
    
    - Our paper takes a different approach and instead of a separate
    size irrelevance rule we make the typing and congruence rules for
    application of $\forall i. T$ to be irrelevant in the size, like so:

      - get rules from the paper

   The intuition is that we are approximating curry-style equality for
   church-style terms: the sizes in the application are there as
   annotations for a typechecking algorithm, but they are actually
   ignored by the type theory itself.

   Concretely, the reason we can be so liberal with sizes is that
   in our type theory they never affect the overall ``shape'' of a
   type, as size expressions only appear in size applications and as
   indexes of datatypes, and there's no size-case. That means that the
   same type directed eta equality rules will apply to both $t = u :
   T[i:=a]$ and $t = u : T[i:=b]$.

   - We prove conversion decidable by presenting a Normalization by
   Evaluation algorithm its proofs of soundness and completeness.
   The nbe includes the usual reflection and reification steps, which
   take a type to orchestrate expansion to eta-long normal forms.   
   The notion of type shapes comes back in the completeness proof, as
   the types provided to reflection and reification end up diverging
   from the type we want to compare the terms at. 
   But all is well as long as the formers are the same approximate
   shape as the latter (defined formally in the paper), because they
   will trigger the same eta-expansions.
   We just have to generalize the corresponding theorems to get the
   induction through.
   
   - limitations:
     - still wish we could have an incremental whnf and
     head-comparison conversion checking. the algorithm would have to
     figure out a suitable size ``b'' to use in the type in the
     congruence rule, probably by some kind of unification algorithm.
     
     - ignoring sizes in typing is not necessarily how you want to do
     it either, using the semantics from the parametric quantifiers
     paper as a guide we want to develop a theory with an
     heterogeneous judgmental equality.
     The judgment would be a decidable approximation of
     paths-over-a-bridge.

\subsection{Third Part}
- Decidability of Conversion.
 - previous part proposes extensions of type theory.
 - such extensions better be consistent and usefully increase expressivity, but also be implementable.
 - Proof assistants like Coq, Agda and Idris insist on a decidable judgmental equality and normal forms for terms. 
 - intensional type theory with decidable equality/normalization has plenty of nice properties simplifying an implementation:
   - liberally run programs in types, useful for small scale reflection, program inference
   - not only no need to store equality derivations, but can erase/omit types in eliminations (and introductions with bidirectionality) in terms
      - normalization used to show equivalence between type-annotated and type-free terms (cite internship with coquand and peter).
         - eliminations only left applied to neutrals, whose types can be inferred.

   - extensional type theory implementations like NuPRL and Andromeda
   offer you program construction tactics so that the user can have finer control over these.
    - mitigate some but not all (annotations left?).

 - When extending ITT one would like to prove such nice properties are
 preserved, and ultimately that a reasonable typechecking algorithm
 can be deployed. A big part is proving that there's an algorithm for
 deciding conversion.
   - that's not easy, a major complication is that with universes types can have arbitrary reduction. See (1) a bit later.
 
 - One option is to prove a normalization theorem by for example
 Normalization By Evaluation as we did above, then the algorithm is ``fully normalize then compare''.
   - That's not what happens in Agda or minitt where the algorithm is ``whnf, then compare heads, then recurse in subterms''
   - If normalization happens lazily then the two algorithms can actually have very similar executions, but that's a quite brittle correspondence.
   
   - However a practical elaborator/typechecker might have to
   interleave things with unification, and then the full normalization
   would get in the way of efficiency: great care is taken to avoid
   unnecessary reductions, also you would still need to propagate
   types and everything when comparing the normal forms so might as
   well interleave reduction in?
   

 - So here in this paper we take the option of formalizing the
 correctness of a conversion checking algorithm based on typed whnf and
 type-directed comparison, the latter needed for eta rules on singleton types.

 - we establish algorithmic equality/conversion as its own thing, a
 relation, for which we show decidability, and equivalence to
 judgmental equality

 - regarding the relationship with normalization, from a proof that a
 term is algorithmically equal to itself we can extract by induction a
 normal form for the term and a proof that it's j.equal to the
 original.

 - proof goes by kripke logical relation with contexts as worlds and renamings as morphisms between worlds.
 
   - by analogy to gluing constructions, could reasonably expected to
   be extended to new theories with presheaf models by taking richer
   morphisms than just renamings.
   Might need to deploy kripke trick more often, because fewer
   predicates might be naturally monotonic, also might need to care
   about naturality.
   -- TODO: check whether this could extend to simon's proof.

 - the kripke part handles open terms.
   
 - the logical relation is based on reduction, we look at the whnf of
 things, for types it's inductive and just recurses in the subterms,
 for terms it's recursive on the proof of type reducibility, and checks that
 the observations that apply to the term whnf, according to the whnf of
 the type, should also be reducible.
   - (1) once the fundamental lemma is proven, this helps clarifying
     the meaning of the typing and equality
     judgments, intuitive things like injectivity of type constructors,
     and other inversions are not easy to establish given
     the declarative formulation of judgmental equality
     and computation in types. (check the consequences file)
 
   - the fundamental theorem is proven as usual by quantifying over a
   reducible substitution (however we package this quantification in
   the $||-^v$ relation), and by showing that the identity substitution
   is reducible.
 
 - Earlier proofs relied on two distinct logical relations with their
 own fundamental lemmas, one to establish the aforementioned inversion
 properties, another to prove the algorithm is complete.
 The two relations differ by which equality relation is used to
 compare terms, judgmental or algorithmic equality/conversion.
 
 Two log. rels and lemmas might be the most pragmatic presentation in
 a paper: you are not going to write out the proof for all the cases
 again, and it would otherwise be hard to keep track of all the
 assumptions necessary if one tries to create an abstraction to reuse.

 When it comes to formalized proofs the incentives and difficulties
 are reversed: you do have to provide complete proofs and the
 typechecker keeps track of whether you are missing something. So
 after formalizing the fundamental lemma for the first log. rel. we
 abstracted over judgmental equality in the definition of the relation
 and the properties needed for the fundamental lemma to go through
 while also keeping an eye on what would be easily provable for
 algorithmic equality.  We obtained a notion we called ``generic
 equality'' which we use to parametrize the fundamental
 lemma\footnote{Here I'd like to insert a special acknowlegment to
   Joakim, who has performed the bulk of the formalization and derived
   this abstraction}, which we then instantiate twice for the two
 equalities of interest.
   - maybe say what things about judg. equality we need to prove that
   algorithmic equality is a generic equality. To make it clear why we need two stages like this.
   
 - We believe this formalization can form a good basis for applying
 the proof technique to more complex theories, though we might need
 some more abstraction passes to avoid too much copy-pasting programming.

 - Easy steps: more automated substition development, extension to
 more of the standard type formers, recursive types. generalize to universe hierarchy.

 - Hard steps: how do you programmatically reuse proofs about e.g. Pi
 types when typing judgments themselves might have to change? Maybe
 just better to have easily modifiable code than trying to predict a
 good abstraction (e.g. plenty of nothing, other modality-annotated pi types, ..., how to fit them in?).
 
 - Also doubles as a first step in bootstrapping Agda: could be
 reasonably turned into a double checker for the core calculus.
