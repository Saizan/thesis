% A general sentence about type theory first:
% mini-history
% applied in software verification and formalized mathematics

Datatypes in type theory come with an appropriate induction or
coinduction principle which gives a precise and concise specification
of what definitions are allowed. Such principles, however, are in some
cases quite inconvenient to use.

% In this thesis, we investigate more convenient alternatives
% to direct uses of the (co)inductive principle.

% As a first contribution, we consider the n-truncation of a type
% in HoTT...

An example from Homotopy Type Theory is the n-truncation of a type
where we are allowed to eliminate only into another n-truncated type.
For n-truncations we implement a derived eliminator into an
(n+1)-truncated type, having instead extra conditions on the behaviour
of the underlying function.

% As a second contribution, we improve on type-based criteria
% for termination and productivity, which allow definitions
% by pattern matching and recursion as an alternative to
% the use of (co)induction principles.

For more ordinary recursive datatypes the structural (co)recursion
principles are quite restrictive, and syntactic termination checks
often prevent the use of higher order combinators. By augmenting the
types with information about well-foundedness, both guarded and sized
types allow, instead, the definition of functions in a style that is
closer to direct general recursion.

By augmenting the types with information about well-foundedness,
functions can be formulated in a style
closer to direct general recursion.
We consider two such augmentations: guarded types, and sized types.

% Guarded types

-- add more general guarded types intro?
In Guarded Cubical Type Theory we equip the fixed point combinator
guarded by the later modality with a path to its one-step
unfolding. The notion of path from Cubical Type Theory allows us to
introduce such an equality without losing canonicity or decidability
of conversion.

% Sized types, on the other hand, ...

Sized types need a propositional equality where values of datatypes
can be identified even when they differ by size annotations. Our
approach is to introduce new quantifiers for "irrelevant" size
quantification. We present a type theory with parametric quantifiers
and derive initial algebras and final coalgebras using a type Size
equipped with parametric well-founded induction. We also develop a
conversion checking algorithm, based on NbE, for a more specific
theory where the new quantifiers are restricted to sizes.

% "3rd contribution"

For the extensions considered above we would like to devise a
practical conversion checking algorithm based on weak head reduction,
so that it would be easy to integrate into a proof assistant. We
formalized the correctness of such an algorithm for a small but
challenging core calculus with natural numbers, a universe, and pi
types with eta-equality, proving that conversion is decidable. We
expect this development to form a good basis to verify more complex
theories.

% The ideas discussed in this thesis already influence the
% development of Agda, an proof assistant based on type theory.
