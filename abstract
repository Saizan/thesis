elimination/corecursion: principled but sometimes hard to use.

- example truncations as initial generated n-truncated type, how to
  eliminate into a (n+1)-truncated.

- guarded/sized types provide more general termination checking by
  using types themselves. Both however need a more extensional
  equality.

- guarded cubical type theory includes a total fixed point
  eliminator through a modality called later and combines it with cubical type theory
  to obtain bisimilarity as equality for codata without resorting to
  the reflection rule.

- sized types need a prop. equality where values of (co)data can be
  equal even when they differ by size annotations. Our approach is to
  introduce a new quantifier for "irrelevant" size quantification.  We
  explore its denotational semantics within a type theory designed for
  parametricity, and a conversion checking algorithm, based on NbE,
  for a more specific theory.

  A lot of the game in the above is to try to add more equalities,
  definitional and/or prop., to the theory while keeping type checking
  decidable. The closer a calculus gets to be undecidable the more
  challenging the proof that it isn't. For a core calculus with
  natural numbers a universe and pi types we formalized the
  correctness of a practical conversion algorithm based on weak head
  reduction and type directed comparisons, proving decidability. We
  expect the development to form a good basis to tackle more
  complex theories.
